UUGear's [Witty Pi 4 Realtime Clock and Power Management HAT](https://www.uugear.com/product/witty-pi-4/) for Raspberry Pi 4B is provided with configuration software to

* synchronize Real Time Clock (RTC) with Network Time

These functions must be present after the network is initialized and before other telemetry apps start.
